The aim of this project was to analyze whether the choice of using a certain song to support
the message of a certain advertisement is conditioned by the business sector of the promoting
company. Analyses were performed on the audio characteristics of songs (found on Spotify)
to identify recurring patterns and an attempt was made to train a machine learning model
capable of predicting, given a specific song, for which sectors it might be considered best suited.
