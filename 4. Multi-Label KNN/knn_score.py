'''
Predictions are evaluated by ranking, employing the Leave One Out method. 
At each iteration the probability values obtained in the y_pred vector are sorted, 
keeping track of the initial indices representing the various domains, 
creating for each probability a tuple (<index>, <probability>)

The variables first and last passed as arguments to the KNN_score() function are used as follows.
The indices of the sectors in y_pred for the iterated positions in the first-last range (inclusive) are fetched, 
and if the indices stored as true labels for y_test are present among the sectors in this range, 
the score value referring to each position for the considered sector is incremented.
